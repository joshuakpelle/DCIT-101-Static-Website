                Most business and system requirements need time for assessment and preparation of a measured response. This level of engagement requires formal paperwork and time. But sometimes customers need a quick insight and outsiders' view on an urgent matter. Kpelle Software Consult can help with a rapid response. Quality and speed of our response remains the same , but response may be based on limited information hence it comes without further obligations.
